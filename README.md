## Themes

### 1. API Infrastructure
Examples:
- An API gateway that auto-generates API docs and adds simple auth/rate limiting via YAML config
- A service that monitors API changes and alerts on breaking changes by comparing OpenAPI specs
- A service that merges multiple Swagger/OpenAPI specs into a single unified API documentation

### 2. Data Governance/Management
Examples:
- A data lineage tracker that automatically maps data flows between services
- A PII detection and masking service for API responses
- A tool that generates fake but realistic test data based on production schemas

### 3. Developer Tooling
Examples:
- A postman-like tool that records and replays API interactions for testing
- A development proxy that simulates network conditions and failure scenarios

### 4. Monitoring & Telemetry
Examples:
- A real-time API performance monitoring dashboard
- An error pattern detection system for API logs
- An anomaly detection system for API usage patterns
